## Bank Robbery System
### By Rage

Built originally for my DarkRP server, I've decided to publish this as open source and put it on the workshop for others to enjoy. I've attempted to the best of my ability to make this bug-free, but I'm sure there will be problems here and there. I don't plan to update this very often unless major bugs are found, so leave all feedback in the workshop comments.

**GTA 5 inspired Bank Robbery System for DarkRP**
**Functionality**
- While an active robbery is occurring, the more the money is damaged/shot, the less the player gets when payed out.
- Bank robbery fails when player goes to jail, gets arrested, or dies.
- All cops are notified.
- Much more!

**Pros**
- Easy configurable
  - Configure cooldown, raid timer, maximum amount the vault can carry, total cops, allowed jobs, and more!
- Fast & easy installation [drag n' drop]
- Quick support

**Problem?**
Ask for support in the steam comment section. I will try and get back to you as soon as possible.
